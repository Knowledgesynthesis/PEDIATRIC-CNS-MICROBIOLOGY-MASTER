# **PEDIATRIC CNS MICROBIOLOGY MASTER — OPTIMIZED MASTER PROMPT FOR EDUCATIONAL APP GENERATION**

A **mobile-first**, **dark-mode**, **offline-ready**, pathology–resident–level educational platform focused on **Pediatric CNS Microbiology**, exactly as covered in a **neuropathology rotation**, **pediatric neuropathology block**, or standard references (e.g., neuropathology/microbiology texts — conceptual only).

This app must include:
- Developmental CNS immune physiology (age-specific vulnerabilities)  
- Neonatal & pediatric meningitis, ventriculitis, encephalitis  
- Pediatric CNS viral infections (DNA & RNA viruses)  
- Pediatric CNS bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections  
- Congenital TORCH infections  
- Pediatric prion disease basics (conceptual only)  
- CNS abscesses and empyemas  
- Pathognomonic cartoon features for organisms & host response  
- CSF patterns (cellular, biochemical — **conceptual, educational only**)  
- Neuropathology of infectious injury (necrosis, microglial nodules, neuronophagia)  
- Patterns on synthetic LM, IHC, special stains, and basic EM cartoons  
- Pitfalls & mimics  
- Integrated synthetic CNS infectious cases for pediatric populations  
- NO patient identifiers, NO real micrographs, NO clinical management guidance  

All diagrams must be **synthetic icons**, not real micrographs. No treatment algorithms. No PHI. No score tracking.

2. Localize pattern (meninges, ventricles, parenchyma).  
3. Evaluate inflammation type: neutrophils, lymphocytes, granulomas.  
4. Look for inclusion cartoons.  
5. Identify organisms (shape + stain cartoon logic).  
6. Evaluate chronicity (calcifications, necrosis).  
7. Apply IHC/EM conceptually.  
8. Integrate into broad infectious category.  
9. Assess pitfalls.

Pitfalls:  
- Overcalling viral inclusions
